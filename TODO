Short term items:

* Think for ways for ocserv to co-exist on the same system with
  an HTTPS server (while sharing the same port).

* IPv6 support is probably broken or non-optimal. See how it can be
  improved.

* More elaborate checks on "make check". Currently we test whether a
  cookie can be obtained, but not whether a TUN devices is created or
  data can be transfered. Need more ideas on how that can be done.

* When a user (IP) gets into the BAN list multiple times, disable it for
  longer time (or should we drop this functionality altogether and rely
  on PAM handling that?)

* Change into hashtables the lists that are used during a client
  connection.

* Give each worker a limited number of accesses to the security module.

* Use nanopb, or another C-based protocolbuffer implementation to pack
  messages exchanged from worker to main.

Long term items:

* Think how the DTLS part can use better negotiation of algorithms and DTLS
  versions than the current openssl string approach (using PSK ciphersuites
  seem to be like a solution, but then we could not use the session ID to
  forward the UDP connection to the proper worker).

* Certificate authentication to the main process. Possibly that is just
  wishful thinking. To verify the TLS client certificate verify signature 
  packet one needs instead of the signature, the contents of all the handshake 
  messages, and knowledge of the negotiated TLS version, in addition to being 
  able to select the server hello random. That could be done sanely only if 
  gnutls provided facilities to set the server hello random, and override the 
  client signature verification at an early stage before data are hashed 
  (to verify that the set random value was present in the handshake).
