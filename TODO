* Add a simple username/password back-end
* Add path MTU discovery
* Run a server up/down script
* Keep the TLS key and certificates into the privileged process and use IPC
  for operations (this will make the privileged process a bottleneck).
* session resumption in main TLS
  - session db should be kept on main thread and resumption should be
    allowed only when it is requested from the same IP as the original
* Handle multiple clients in a single tun device (check if needed at all)
