* Add a simple username/password back-end
* Certificate authentication to the main process (can it be done without
  moving all the TLS handshake over the main thread?)
* Keep the TLS key and certificates into the privileged process and use IPC
  for operations (this will make the privileged process a bottleneck).
* Add path MTU discovery
* Allow the usage of PSK ciphersuites instead of the non-standard cisco 
  resumption mode for DTLS.
